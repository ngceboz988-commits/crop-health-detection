# Crop Health Detection MVP

A Streamlit web application that uses machine learning to detect whether crops are healthy or diseased from uploaded images. This project demonstrates an AI-powered approach to crop monitoring, aimed at helping farmers quickly identify potential crop diseases.

## Features
- Upload crop images via a simple web interface
- Real-time prediction of crop health (Healthy vs Diseased)
- Built as a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for rapid testing and deployment

## Technology Stack
- **Python**  
- **TensorFlow / PyTorch** (for CNN model training)  
- **Streamlit** (for web interface)  
- **OpenCV, PIL, NumPy, Pandas** (for image processing and data handling)

## How to Run Locally
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ngceboomaphumulo-blip/crop-health-detection.git
